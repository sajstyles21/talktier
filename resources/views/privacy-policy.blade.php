<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window)&nbsp; or after two year of continuous inactivity, unless:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must keep it to comply with applicable law (for example, some &ldquo;traffic data&rdquo; is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for 5 years);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it's resolved; or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention, and enhancing user&rsquo;s safety and security. For instance, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incident from opening a new account</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted with a specific time frame due to technical constraints</span></p>
