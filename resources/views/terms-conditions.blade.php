                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Items. From time to time you may be able to purchase a limited, personal, non transferable, non sublicensable, revocable license to use &ldquo;virtual items,&rdquo; which could include virtual products or virtual &ldquo;coins&rdquo; or other units that are exchangeable within the Service for virtual products (collectively, &ldquo;Virtual Items&rdquo;). Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, with TalkTier ceases providing the Service, or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. TalkTier, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. TalkTier may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. TalkTier shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that TalkTier exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for the use in the Service is a service that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TALKTIER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Refunds.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within 14 days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iow, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, the terms below apply:</span></p>
